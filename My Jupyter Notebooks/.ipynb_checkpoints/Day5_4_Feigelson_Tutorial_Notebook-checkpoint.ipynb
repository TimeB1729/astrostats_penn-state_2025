When only the dataset if available without prior knowledge of the groups, the problem is called _clustering_.  When prior knowledge in the form of training sets with labels for the groups are available, the problem is called _classification_.  The availability of reliable training sets can be remarkably helpful: classification procedures often give far more effective results than clustering procedures.**"

This makes sense when (as in this case) all variables have the same units and similar range, but can be problematic when variables of very different units and ranges are combined.  Also, there is a worry that the k-NN voting will depend on the artificial choice made of the sizes of the training sets (2000 for quasars, 2000 for white dwarfs, and 5000 for stars). As we will see when we apply a classifier to the test set, these sample numbers are far from realistic.
